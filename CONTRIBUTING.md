- Add semicolons at the end of statements
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible
- Run `npm run format` before committing

### File Organization

- Place new components in `src/components/`
- Place new formatters in `src/formatters/`
- Place utility functions in `src/utils/`
- Add types in `src/types/`
- Add examples in `examples/`
- Add tests in `test/`

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: Use kebab-case (e.g., `my-component.ts`)
- **Classes**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `MyComponent`)
- **Functions**: Use camelCase (e.g., `myFunction`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`)

```

### Test Organization
